1.
we created a Flora class which is in charge of all the flora in the game - trees, leaves and fruits.
the Flora class has a createInRange method, that creates all the trees in a given range, where for every
block unit we toss a coin and can build a tree there.
The trees are saved as a list of list of blocks, where the first part of the list is the list of
blocks that compose the tree and the other part are the parts that compose the leaves.
Leaves in this case are a different class as they have the wiggling (in the wind) functionality.
when creating  the leaves, we randomly create fruits, using the Fruit class extending gameobject.
The fruit class has a special functionality where whenever the avatar takes it,
his energy increases (using a callback) and the fruit disappears for 30 seconds, using a scheduledTask.

2.
In addition to the mentioned before - Flora creates directly all the flora units.
In the case of the stumps, it creates them as blocks.
In the case of the leaves and the fruits it uses the matching class, to allow the special functionality

3.
We used callbacks in the package, it was used to give the avatar energy after taking the fruits,
and to wiggle the leaves.
In addition we used the ScheduledTask mechanism.
